# Instructor-Assistant-and-Online-Observer

## Introduction:
Instructors facing difficulties with students in online lectures and exams, since they don’t know the status of the students if they were focusing on the lecture or they are playing with their phones, also with monitoring the attendance status. That’s why we developed a computer vision-based program to assist them to observe students in online lectures and exams.

## Features of the project:

1) Detect the student's attendance status
  - If the student is attending the online lecture or he/she is not there.
2) Detect cell phone appearance in camera view
  - This feature to see if the student is focusing with the online lecture or playing with the cell phone. Another use is in exams cheat detection if they used the phone during the exam or not.
3) Detect the student's sleepiness status
  - Since some students leaves the online lecture open and sleep, so sleepiness detection will be done by detecting the eyes if they’re open or closed
4) Detect the student's attention status
  - This will be applied by using human pose estimation and simple calculation to know the attention status of the student, for example if the student is looking (left – right – up – down) then he/she not giving attention to the online lecture, or to know where they are looking during the exam.

## Conclusion:

In this project we've developed a form of real-time teacher assistant that shows the importance of computer vision in education, and how it assists the instructors in observing students within online lectures and exams. Many fields of computer vision have been applied in this project for example, human pose estimation, object detection and face recognition.
